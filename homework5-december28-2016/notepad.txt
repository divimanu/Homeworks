	The syntax is very simple and clear in HTML5 as compared to HTML 4, In HTML 4 there is an external source to declaration type where as in HTML 5 as simple as <! DOCTYPE html>.
	HTML5 contains built in support for integrated multimedia files into webpages via video and audio tags where as in HTML4 Multimedia was integrated in webpages via third party plugins.
	In HTML4, it was very difficult to get the geographical locations even through mobile devices but in HTML5 it was extremely easy to access the geographical locations either in website or mobile devices.
	In HTML4 there are no web sockets, so difficult to communicate between client and server and it takes long polling, where as in HTML5 there are web sockets that allows full duplex communication between client and server.
	To store data on client side browser’s cache is used but the cache was limited in HTML4 and In HTML5 issue has been addressed via web SQL database and application cache to be access via HTML5’s JavaScript interface.
	Some changes in tags 
HTML4	HTML5
<Applet> removed
<Acronym> removed 

<a> tag used an anchor as well as referring for a link
<meta> tag is defined in the header section and contains information about the data
	<object> added instead of displaying <applet>
<Abbr> added used for abbreviations in web browser.
<a> tag is used only as a hyperlink.
